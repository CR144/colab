# colab

This is a project that we are working on to create a webapp that will allow people to request a certain
layout for their event that will take place at the JCCC CoLab.

The current project members are:
Caleb Durland -- Design
Alex Tate -- Design / Development
Chris Roberts -- Development

If you would like to help or offer a tip here or there, that would be greatly appreciated!
